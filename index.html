			<h1>Abstract</h1>
			<p>Background: Physical exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function in older adults, but the magnitude and consistency of this effect remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of physical exercise on cognitive function in older adults.

                Methods: We searched electronic databases for randomized controlled trials that investigated the effects of physical exercise on cognitive function in adults aged 60 years and older. We extracted data on study design, intervention characteristics, and cognitive outcomes. We used random-effects meta-analysis to calculate effect sizes and heterogeneity.
                
                Results: We included 25 studies with a total of 1,384 participants. Physical exercise had a small-to-medium effect on overall cognitive function (Hedges' g = 0.42, 95% CI 0.29-0.56) and a medium effect on executive function (Hedges' g = 0.51, 95% CI 0.37-0.65). The effects were robust to sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses based on exercise type, duration, and intensity.</p>
