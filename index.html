    <h1> Design of a Testing Setup for Diffusion Coefficient Measurement</h1>

			<h1>Abstract</h1>
			<p>The goal of this project is to assist the Graduate Biomechanics Laboratory team at McGill University in improving the performance
				 of drug-eluting stents. Specifically, the experimental setup must allow for the
				 measurement of the diffusion coefficient of the compound, which is crucial for selecting the right compound and improving stent design.

				To achieve this goal, a Diaphragm Cell method was chosen as an efficient way to measure the diffusion coefficient.
				The method involves two containers with respective volumes, separated by a porous membrane, and solutions of different compositions and concentrations
				placed on either side of the membrane. Both solutions are stirred and allowed to interact, and the diffusion process is measured over time.
				The diffusion coefficient is then calculated based on the initial and final concentrations of the solutions.

				The key concern in this design is to reduce leakage. Three designs were created, and the chosen design was then iterated upon numerous times to reduce leakage.
				OUr final iteration experienced no leakage in the entirety of the experiment, and will be used by the Graduate Biomechanics Laboratory for future research.
